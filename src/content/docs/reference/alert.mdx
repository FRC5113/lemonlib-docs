title: Alert
description: Custom system for getting and sending alerts in your code
---
{/*We should really change this to LemonAlert for clarity*/}

## Purpose
Allows you to easily send preformatted but custom alerts to the Elastic Dashboard

## Add to files

```py
from lemonlib.util import Alert
<YOUR_ALERT_NAME> = Alert(text: str, type: AlertType, timeout = 0.0: float, elasticnoti = True: bool)
# Text is the actual text of the alert AlertType is specified in the AlertType section, timeout is how long it should stay on the screen (will be multiplied by a 1000, defaults to 3000) and elasticnoti represents if it should be sent to Elastic Dashboard or not

```
{/*Add link to AlertType section, also what unit is timeout in (seconds or milliseconds)*/}

## Methods

```py

Alert.set(active: bool)
# If active is set to true it will activate the alert and send it

Alert.enable()
# Calls Alert.set(True)

Alert.disable()
# Calls Alert.set(False)

Alert.set_text(text: str)
# Sets the alert text to the input value

```
