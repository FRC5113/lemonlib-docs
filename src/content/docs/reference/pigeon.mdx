description: A wrapper for the CTRE pigeon gyro
---

## Purpose
The purpose of this component is to provide a high level api for working with Pigeon 2.0 gyroscopes. Its source is held at /lemonlib/ctre/pigeon.py if you want to edit or make a pull request.

## Add to files
You can add the lemonPigeon class to your file like this
```py
from lemonlib.ctre import LemonPigeon
```
To insatiate a new instance do the following

```py
#Your existing code ... (must be in a class)
self.<YOUR_VAR_NAME> = LemonPigeon(canID: int)
```
The canId variable should be well, the can id, which you can get with the Rev Hardware Client

## Methods

{/*Chase check return types is it float or a wpimath thing*/}
```py
LemonPigeon.getAngleCCW() # Returns the current yaw (Float)

LemonPigeon.getRoll() # Returns the current roll (Float)

LemonPigeon.getPitch() # Returns the current pitch (Float)

LemonPigeon.getDegreesPerSecCCW() # Returns the angular velocity in degrees (Float)

LemonPigeon.getRadiansPerSecCCW() # Returns the angular velocity in radians (Float)

LemonPigeon.getRotation2d() # Gets the current heading of the robot, note it does not wrap around so after 360 is 361 not zero (wpimath.geometry.Rotation2c)

LemonPigeon.setAngleAdjustment(angle: Int) # Sets the current offset, so if you want to set the current direction to zero you could do setAngleAdjustment(0) (void)
```
