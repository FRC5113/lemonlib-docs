description: A wrapper for the CTRE pigeon gyro
---

## Purpose
The purpose of this component is to provide a high level api for working with Pigeon 2.0 gyroscopes. Its source is held at /lemonlib/ctre/pigeon.py if you want to edit or make a pull request.

## Add to files
You can add the lemonPigeon class to your file like this
```py
from lemonlib.ctre import LemonPigeon
```
To insatiate a new instance do the following

```py
#Your existing code ... (must be in a class)
self.<YOUR_VAR_NAME> = LemonPigeon(canID: int)
```
The canId variable should be well, the can id, which you can get with the Rev Hardware Client

## Methods

{/*Chase check return types is it float or a wpimath thing*/}
```py
LemonPigeon.getAngleCCW() -> Float # Returns the current yaw 

LemonPigeon.getRoll() -> Float # Returns the current roll 

LemonPigeon.getPitch() -> Float # Returns the current pitch 

LemonPigeon.getDegreesPerSecCCW() -> Float # Returns the angular velocity in degrees 

LemonPigeon.getRadiansPerSecCCW() -> Float # Returns the angular velocity in radians 

LemonPigeon.getRotation2d() -> wpimath.geometry.Rotation2D # Gets the current heading of the robot, note it does not wrap around so after 360 is 361 not zero

LemonPigeon.setAngleAdjustment(angle: Int) -> None # Sets the current offset, so if you want to set the current direction to zero you could do setAngleAdjustment(0)
