description: An easy way to control large groups of LED's

---

## Purpose
It is sometimes difficult to control large groups of LED's based on your robot's state, this tries to fix that.

## Add to files
```py

from lemonlib.util import LEDController
LEDController(pwm_port: int, length: int)
# pwm_port is the port the LED's are on and length is the number of lights
```

## Methods
```py

LEDController.apply_pattern(pattern: wpilib.LEDPattern) -> None
#Applies a pattern to your LED's based on a wpilib.LEDPattern

LEDController.set_solid_color(color: Tupple[int, int, int]) -> None
#Sets all LED's to the selected color        r    g    b

LEDController.set_pixel(index: int, color: Tupple[int, int, int]) -> None
#Sets specifed LED to the selected color          r    g    b

LEDController.set_gradient(start_color: Tupple[int, int, int], end_color: Tupple[int, int, int])
#Will create a gradient going back and forth between the start_color and the end_color at a set time

LEDController.static_rainbow(offset: int = 0) -> None
#Custom preset that Creates a rainbow effect across the LED strip. The offset parameter (in degrees) can be used to animate the rainbow.

LEDController.scrolling_rainbow(speed: float = 1) -> None
#Creates a scrolling rainbow with a custom speed

LEDController.move_across(color: Tupple[int, int, int], size: int = 1, hertz: wpimath.units.hertz = 1) -> None
#Moves a block of LEDs across the strip using RobotController.getTime() for timing.

LEDController.clear() -> None
#Turns off all LED's 
```
