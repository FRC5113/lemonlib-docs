title: Kiwi Sim
desciption: A module for simulating the behavior of kiwi drive robots
---

## Purppose
This module abstracts away most of the complexity of kiwi drive simulations and allows you to easily test and verify your code works in a WPILIB sim

## Add to files
To add to files do the follwing

```py
from lemonlib.simulation import KilloughDriveSim

KilloughDriveSim(drive : ADD_TYPE_ANNOTATION, mass = 50.0 : float, moment_of_inertia = 10.0: float, wheel_force = 100.0: float)
#Drive is <WHAT IS DRIVE??>, mass is the mass of your robat in grams (IS THAT CORRECT), moment_of_inertia is self explanitory, wheel_force is <WHAT IS WHEEL FORCE>
```

## Methods
```py
KilloughDriveSim.update(dt = 0.02: float) -> None
#Updates your sim, dt is the time since last "update"

KilloughDriveSim.get_pose() -> wpimath.geometry.Pose2D
# Gets the current pose of your robot, both in teleop and auton.
```
