class MyRobot(LemonRobot):
    #Your methods
```

## Methods

{/*Ryan there are way more methods right??*/}
```py

LemonRobot.add_periodic(self, callback: Callable[[], None], period: float) -> None
#Pass in a callback function that will be executed on every period call of teleopPeriodic, so if period is 2 every other call, if period is 1 every call etc. (every cycle)

LemonRobot.autonomous() -> None
#Runs all code in autonomous_periodic

LemonRobot.get_period() -> float
#Gets period of the robot in seconds (how many seconds per cycle)
```
