title: FalconSim
desciption: Easily control simulations of Falcon motors

---

## Purpose
Allows teams to easily simulate Falcon motors

## Add to files

```py
from lemonlib.simulation import FalconSim

self.<Your Variable Name> = FalconSim(motor: TalonFX, moi: float, gearing: float) -> FalconSim
#Motor should be the instance of the Pheonix6 TalonFX, moi is <ADD WHAT MOI IS>, and gearing is the gear ratio on the motor
```

## Methods
{/*Ryan, is my def for getSetpoint correct*/}
```py
FalconSim.getSetpoint() -> Float #Returns the current motor voltage at the sim state 

FalconSim.update(dt: float) -> float # dt stands for Delta Time and it is the ammount of time passed since the last call.


```
