title: LemonCamSim
description: Adds the ability to simulate LemonCam while useing the PhotonCamSim methods you already know
---

## Purppose
{/*Chase add link to LemonCam sim docs*/}
Easily simulate LemonCam's (for instructions on how to use LemonCam see their documentation (here)["/reference/lemoncam"])

## Add to files

```py
from lemonlib.simulation import LemonCamSim

LemonCameraSim(camera: LemonCamera, feild_layout: robotpy_apriltag.AprilTagFeildLayout, fov = 100.0: float, fps: int = 20, avg_latency = 0.035: float, latency_std_dev = 0.005: float)
#Camera is prety self explanatory, it is the camera you are simulating, feild_layout is the layout of the AprilTag's such as ApriltagFeild.k2024Crescendo, fov is the horizntal feild of visson in degrees, fps is how many frames per second you are simulating at, and then avg_latency and latency_std_dev are what they sound like but using the default values should not hurt you to much, this also assumes the camera is in the center of the robot looking straight foward, if it is not it should be a negligable diffrence 
```

## Methods
This class inherits from PhotonCameraSim so you can use all of those methods as well as these
```py
LemonCameraSim.update(pose: wpimath.geometry.Pose2D) -> None
#Updates the sim to the new pose
```
