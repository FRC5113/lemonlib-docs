title: Kiwi (Killough) Drive
Description: An implementation of the Kiwi Drive train that abstracts most of the annoying math
---

## Purpose
This section provides a high level API for working with Killough Drive often called "Kiwi Drive", there is a lot of annoying trig invoked but this class gets rid of most of it.

## Add to File
You can add the `KilloughDrive` class to your file like this
```py
from lemonlib.drive import KilloughDrive
```
To insatiate a new instance do the following

```py
#Your existing code ... (must be in a class)
self.<YOUR_VAR_NAME> = KilloughDrive(front_right_motor: MotorController, front_left_motor: MotorController, back_motor: MotorController, angles=None)
```
Bellow is a diagram of kiwi drive

            ---
{/*Ryan WTF does angles do*/}
The motors are instances of `wpilib.interface.MotorController` (Like `LemonTalonFX`) and angles is _TOADD_


{/*The definition for drive_cartesian is way to long*/}
{/*Also for _apply_felid_oriented_control, what are vx and vy and what is return val also calculate_wheel_speeds*/}
{/*Note: This does not include _methods, they are assumed to be private*/}
## Methods
```py

KilloughDrive._calculate_transform_matrix() # Precompute the wheel transformation matrix based on configured angles (void)

KilloughDrive.drive_cartesian(ySpeed: float, xSpeed: float, omega: float, gyro_angle: float = 0.0) -> None
# Drive method for Killough platform.
        # Angles are measured clockwise from the positive X axis. The robot's speed is independent
        # from its angle or rotation rate.

        # :param ySpeed: The robot's speed along the Y axis [-1.0..1.0]. Right is positive.
        # :param xSpeed: The robot's speed along the X axis [-1.0..1.0]. Forward is positive.
        # :param omega: The robot's rotation rate around the Z axis [-1.0..1.0]. Clockwise is positive.
        # :param gyro_angle: The current angle reading from the gyro in degrees around the Z axis.
        #                    Use this to implement field-oriented controls.
        

KilloughDrive.drive_polar(magnitude: float, angle: float, zRotation: float) -> None
#Drive method for Killough platform using polar coordinates.

        # Angles are measured counter-clockwise from straight ahead. The speed at which the robot
        # drives (translation) is independent from its angle or zRotation rate.

        # :param magnitude: The robot's speed at a given angle [-1.0..1.0]. Forward is positive.
        # :param angle: The angle around the Z axis at which the robot drives in degrees [-180..180].
        # :param zRotation: The robot's rotation rate around the Z axis [-1.0..1.0]. Clockwise is positive.

KilloughDrive.normalize(self, v1: float, v2: float, v3: float) -> (float, float, float) # Normalizes wheel inputs (v1-v3) between 0 and 1

KilloughDrive.get_position() -> wpimath.geometry.Pose2D # Gets the approximate position of the robot, calculated with dead reckoning, so use with caution.

KilloughDrive.initSendable(builder: wpiutil.SendableBuilder) -> None #Initializes the sendable interface for SmartDashboard integration.
